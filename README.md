# Freeform Portland Admin Application and API

### Set Up Local Development Environment on OSX:

Clone the repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:marciaga/playlist-v2.git
```
(If you're on a Mac, we recommend installing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

Ensure you have a compatible version of Node and NPM:
```
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```
We use Node `6.9.1` and NPM `3.10.9` and recommend globally installing [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage your Node versions.

Next, install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) which we use for managing dependencies. If you're on a Mac you can use `Homebrew`:
```
$ brew install yarn
```

or `npm`:

```
$ npm i yarn -g
```
or just install the binary!

```
$ curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

Now, install the dependencies with:
```
$ yarn
```

Next, you'll need a running instance of `MongoDB` version `>=3.2`. To install, we recommend using `Homebrew`:
```
$ brew install mongodb
```

Run the `MongoDB` server:
```
$ mongod
```
We advise leaving the terminal window open while the server is running. When you want to stop the server, use: `Ctrl + c`.

Before continuing, you'll need to obtain a data dump from another developer on the project. We use the native `MongoDB` archive format, so the file will be `admindump.archive`. To import it, first, be sure the `mongod` server is running. Then, from the directory in which the archive file is, run
```
$ mongorestore --gzip --archive=admindump.archive
```

You'll also need a `.env` file, whose values you can obtain from another developer on the project. An example `.env.example` is in the project directory, so you can
```
$ cp .env.example .env
```
then fill in the values.

Before starting the app for the first time, you'll need to build the main CSS file, which can be done with (this step need be done only the first time):
```
$ yarn build:css
```

Now you can run the app:
```
$ yarn dev
```
Note that the command `$ yarn dev` also runs the CSS watcher.

The app is available in your browser at `localhost:3000`.

### Alternative Local Environment Using Docker
First, install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

Next, clone the repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:marciaga/playlist-v2.git
```

You'll need to change your `.env` file to connect to the MongoDB container properly
`DB_CONNECTION=mongodb://db:27017`

Next, run:
```
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```
This command will build the images, install the dependencies, and start the application in development mode. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`


## Tests
We use the `Jest` testing framework.
To run the tests, use:
```
$ yarn test
```

## Code Style
We use ESLint to ensure style consistency:
```
$ yarn lint
```

## Adding New Dependencies
It's important to not use `npm` to add dependencies because they won't be added to the `yarn.lock` file. Instead, to add to `dependencies` use
```
$ yarn add <package>
```
or to add to `devDependencies`, use
```
$ yarn add -D <package>
```
