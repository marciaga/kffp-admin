Danny pursued his interests in performing stand-up comedy and studying documentary filmmaking to Portland in May, 2000. He cofounded theater and short film collective Extra Medium Sketch Comedy and mobile music video museum Eye Candy VJs, which is still featured several nights weekly in bars and restaurants. He continues to hoard unconventional recordings to enjoy at home, but is excited to share his collection with friends and strangers over Freeform Portland's airwaves.

New demos of honest, untested bands from around the world are the things that would keep this show going. Each show begins with the local scene report that exposes the bands that are playing frequently around town or just came out with a new demo or album. Root for the underdogs! This show would give me a chance to display these lesser known bands within a cohesive but eclectic playlist of other more established like-minded artists in hopes to tie various DIY scenes in Portland for a more tight knit community.",

The DJs\u00a0engage guests in discussions about how music affects their artistic practice, which music obsessions they have and why, memories of the local music and art scene, and what makes them tick creatively in general. More of a casual conversation than an interview, Studio Visit desires to uncover hidden sides of the local art scene in an idiosyncratic, random and synesthetic way.",
