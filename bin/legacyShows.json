Danny pursued his interests in performing stand-up comedy and studying documentary filmmaking to Portland in May, 2000. He cofounded theater and short film collective Extra Medium Sketch Comedy and mobile music video museum Eye Candy VJs, which is still featured several nights weekly in bars and restaurants. He continues to hoard unconventional recordings to enjoy at home, but is excited to share his collection with friends and strangers over Freeform Portland's airwaves. Jesuit Bit My Hotdog is a comical allusion to Industrial rock band Ministry's 1992 single \"Jesus Built My Hotrod.\"",
